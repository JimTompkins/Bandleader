Bandleader: the senior's music player

This is an Android app for seniors to be able to play their music.  It was developed in response to
observing that most of the currently available music player apps are not very suitable for 
seniors with little computer skills. 

Bandleader follows these principles:
- No ads
- No popups
- No personal information
- No WiFi connection needed: plays local music files only
- Free - donation requested
- Large buttons with space between
- Large text, min 16pt
